	1.1. Instruction [here](https://github.com/H2xDev/GodotVMF/blob/master/docs/installation.md)  
2. Create a new game configuration in Hammer++  
	2.1. Set `Game Directory` - `<your_project>\hammer_project`  
	2.2. Set `Hammer VMF Directory` - `<your_project>\hammer_project\mapsrc`  
	2.3. Set `Prefab Directory` - `<your_project>\hammer_project\mapsrc\prefabs`  
	2.4. Add required FGD - base.fgd and halflife2.fgd (and your custom fgd as well)  
3. Restart Hammer++  

## Usage
